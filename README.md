# SkillProof — Implementation Plan
### *AI-Powered Skill Verification Platform via Video Assessment*
> Stack: React + Node.js + Gemini Vision API | Vibe-Code Ready

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

A candidate records a short task video → Gemini Vision analyzes real skill execution → Tamper-proof digital badge is issued → Employers verify via QR code.

**No fake certificates. No biased interviews. Just proof of actual ability.**

---

## 🎯 Priority Industries

| Priority | Industry | Example Task to Record |
|----------|----------|------------------------|
| 1 | **IT / Software** | Build a React component, write a REST API, debug a live error |
| 2 | **Healthcare** | Wound dressing, BP measurement technique |
| 3 | **Electrical / ITI** | Wiring task, circuit connection |
| 4 | **Hospitality** | Table setup, food plating |
| 5 | **Construction** | Tile laying, plastering |

      |── Candidate Portal (record/upload video + profile)
      |── Employer Portal (search candidates, verify badge via QR)
      |── Admin Dashboard (manage skill categories & rubrics)
      |
[Node.js + Express Backend]
      |
      |── /api/assess      → sends video to Gemini Vision
      |── /api/badge       → generates + stores badge (UUID)
      |── /api/verify/:id  → public QR verification endpoint
      |── /api/auth        → JWT auth for candidates & employers
      |
[Gemini 1.5 Flash Vision API]
      |── Receives video frames + skill rubric prompt
      |── Returns structured JSON assessment
      |

## 🤖 Gemini Prompt System (The Secret Sauce)

### Master Rubric Prompt (in `skillRubrics.js`)

```javascript
const getAssessmentPrompt = (skillName, industry) => `
You are an expert ${industry} skill assessor with 15 years of experience.

Watch this video carefully. The candidate is demonstrating: ${skillName}

Evaluate the candidate on these dimensions and return ONLY valid JSON:

{
  "overallScore": <0-100>,
  "passed": <true if score >= 70>,
  "skillLevel": "<Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced | Expert>",
  "dimensions": {
    "technicalAccuracy": { "score": <0-100>, "observation": "<what you saw>" },
    "efficiency": { "score": <0-100>, "observation": "<what you saw>" },
    "bestPractices": { "score": <0-100>, "observation": "<what you saw>" },
    "problemSolving": { "score": <0-100>, "observation": "<what you saw>" }
  },
  "strengths": ["<strength 1>", "<strength 2>"],
  "improvements": ["<area 1>", "<area 2>"],
  "employerSummary": "<2 sentence plain English summary for a hiring manager>",
  "verifiedSkills": ["<specific skill tag>", "<specific skill tag>"]
}

Be strict. Be honest. A false positive hurts real employers.
Return ONLY the JSON object. No markdown. No explanation.

# 🎯 VIBE CODING PROMPTS
### *Paste these directly into Cursor / Windsurf / GitHub Copilot Chat*

---

## PROMPT 1 — Project Scaffold

```
Create a full-stack project called "SkillProof" with:
- React frontend (Vite) in a /client folder
- Node.js + Express backend in a /server folder
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT authentication with two roles: "candidate" and "employer"
- CORS configured between localhost:3000 and localhost:5000
- .env file support with dotenv
- Basic folder structure:
  server/routes/, server/controllers/, server/models/, server/prompts/
  client/src/pages/, client/src/components/

Create User model with: name, email, password (hashed), role, createdAt
Create register and login endpoints with JWT response
Create a protected middleware to verify JWT on private routes
```

---

## PROMPT 2 — Video Recorder Component

```
Create a React component called VideoRecorder.jsx that:
- Uses the browser's MediaRecorder API to record from the user's webcam + screen (for IT skills, prefer screen + audio)
- Shows a live preview of the recording
- Has a Start Recording / Stop Recording button
- Countdown timer visible during recording (max 5 minutes)
- After stopping, shows the recorded video for review
- Has a "Submit for Assessment" button that uploads the video as multipart/form-data to POST /api/assess
- Shows a loading spinner with message "Gemini is evaluating your skill..." during upload
- On success, navigates to /results/:assessmentId
- Use clean modern UI with Tailwind CSS
```

---

## PROMPT 3 — Gemini Vision Assessment Endpoint

```
Create a Node.js Express route POST /api/assess that:
- Accepts a multipart video file upload using multer (store in /uploads)
- Accepts skillName and industry as body fields
- Reads the skill rubric prompt from server/prompts/skillRubrics.js
- Sends the video file to Google Gemini 1.5 Flash using @google/generative-ai SDK
  (use GoogleGenerativeAI, model: gemini-1.5-flash, with fileManager to upload video first)
- Parses the JSON response from Gemini
- Saves the assessment to MongoDB Assessment model:
  { candidateId, skillName, industry, score, passed, dimensions, strengths, improvements, employerSummary, verifiedSkills, videoPath, createdAt }
- If passed (score >= 70), automatically calls the badge generation function
- Returns the full assessment object + badgeId if generated
- Use try/catch with proper error messages
```

---

## PROMPT 4 — Badge Generation & QR Code

```
Create a badge system in Node.js:

1. Badge model in MongoDB:
{ badgeId (UUID), candidateId, candidateName, skillName, industry, score, skillLevel, verifiedSkills, issuedAt, geminiSummary }

2. POST /api/badge/:assessmentId endpoint:
- Fetches the assessment
- Creates a badge with UUID as badgeId
- Returns the badge data

3. GET /api/verify/:badgeId endpoint (PUBLIC - no auth required):
- Returns full badge data for employer verification
- This is what the QR code points to

4. In React, create BadgeView.jsx:
- Shows a beautiful digital badge card with:
  - Candidate name
  - Skill name + level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Expert)
  - Score with circular progress indicator
  - List of verified skill tags
  - Issue date
  - QR code (use qrcode.react) pointing to /verify/:badgeId
  - "Download Badge" button that saves as PNG
- Use a professional design with deep blue and gold color scheme
```

---

## PROMPT 5 — IT Skill Rubrics

```
Create server/prompts/skillRubrics.js with a function getAssessmentPrompt(skillName, industry) that returns a detailed Gemini prompt.

Include specific rubric dimensions for these IT skills:
1. "React Frontend Development" - evaluate: component structure, hooks usage, code cleanliness, no errors
2. "Node.js API Development" - evaluate: route structure, error handling, status codes, security basics
3. "JavaScript Debugging" - evaluate: root cause identification speed, fix correctness, console usage
4. "SQL Database Querying" - evaluate: query correctness, joins, optimization awareness
5. "Python Scripting" - evaluate: syntax correctness, use of functions, efficiency, libraries
6. "DevOps / Docker" - evaluate: Dockerfile correctness, environment variables, port config

The prompt must instruct Gemini to return ONLY a JSON object with:
overallScore (0-100), passed (bool, true if >=70), skillLevel, dimensions (object with score+observation per dimension), strengths (array), improvements (array), employerSummary (string), verifiedSkills (array of tags)

Make Gemini strict and honest - no inflation of scores.
```

---

## PROMPT 6 — Employer Dashboard

```
Create an Employer Dashboard in React (EmployerDashboard.jsx) that:
- Protected route (requires employer JWT)
- Shows a search bar to filter candidates by: skill name, minimum score, skill level
- Fetches GET /api/candidates?skill=&minScore=&level= from backend
- Displays candidate cards showing: name, skill, score badge, top 3 verified skill tags, "View Full Report" button
- Clicking "View Full Report" opens a modal with:
  - Full Gemini assessment breakdown (dimensions with scores)
  - Strengths and improvement areas
  - The QR badge
  - "Contact Candidate" button (shows email)
- Also add a QR Scanner tab using react-qr-reader that:
  - Activates camera
  - Scans a SkillProof badge QR code
  - Fetches and displays the verification result instantly

Also create backend GET /api/candidates endpoint that queries MongoDB for passed assessments with filters.
```

---

## PROMPT 7 — Landing Page (Demo Killer)

```
Create a stunning landing page (Home.jsx) for SkillProof with Tailwind CSS:

Hero section:
- Headline: "Your Skills. Proven. Not Claimed."
- Subheadline: "Record a 5-minute task. Get AI-verified. Get hired."
- Two CTA buttons: "I'm a Candidate" → /register?role=candidate, "I'm an Employer" → /register?role=employer

How It Works section (3 steps with icons):
1. Record yourself doing a real task
2. Gemini AI evaluates your actual skill
3. Get a verified digital badge employers trust

Industries section showing cards for: IT, Healthcare, Electrical, Hospitality, Construction

Stats bar: "4.7 Cr ITI graduates unverified" | "78% employers hire wrong" | "SkillProof changes this"

Footer with tagline: "Your hands are your resume."

Dark professional theme. Smooth scroll animations. No generic stock photo placeholders.
```

---

## PROMPT 8 — Final Integration & Demo Polish

```
Do a full integration pass on the SkillProof app:

1. Make sure React Router routes are all connected:
   / → Home
   /register → Register (with role param)
   /login → Login  
   /dashboard → CandidateDashboard (protected)
   /record → RecordTask (protected, candidate only)
   /results/:assessmentId → ScoreCard results page
   /badge/:badgeId → BadgeView
   /employer → EmployerDashboard (protected, employer only)
   /verify/:badgeId → VerifyBadge (public)

2. Add a Navbar that shows different links based on role

3. Add toast notifications (use react-hot-toast) for:
   - Successful assessment submission
   - Badge generated
   - Login/register success/error

4. Seed the database with 5 dummy candidate badges for IT skills so the employer demo works immediately

5. Add a prominent demo mode banner on the landing page: 
   "Live Demo: Upload any screen recording and watch Gemini assess it in real time"

Make sure everything is mobile responsive.
```
